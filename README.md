## Fogity
This is a project to create an IOT device for your car to help determine whether or not fog has formed on the windows. This is possible by using the relative humidity inside the car and determining if this value is 100%. If the internal relative humidity is ever 100% then the fog will start to form on the window as a relative humidity can never be higher than 100% and the moisture will form on the most suitable surface. Which will be the car windscreen and other windows.
